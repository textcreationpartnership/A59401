            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A ſafe and eaſy way to obtain free and peaceable Elections, without Impoſition, Noiſe or Charge: Propoſed to Conſideration now the Regulation of Elections is under debate.</head>
            <p>THat none, upon Penalty of being made uncapable to be elected, do by himſelf, Friends, or Court-Letters, ſeek to impoſe himſelf upon the Freeholders.</p>
            <p>That the Writ being iſſued forth, and broken up by the Sheriff in the County Court, the Freeholder being ſworn, or otherwiſe atteſting his Right to Elect, by having a clear Freehold Eſtate of Forty Shillings <hi>per Annum,</hi> and his Name, and place of abode taken by the Clerk.</p>
            <p>Let the Free-Holder put into a Box the Names of the Knights he judgeth moſt meet to ſerve in Parliament, writ in a ſmall Scroll of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, roll'd and ſeal'd up; then let the Judges of the Poll with the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff open the Box, ſearch and ſort the Papers, and find who by this Suffrage are the Elected Knights, who are then to be proclaimed by the Sheriff, and Indentures being ſeal'd by the Sheriff and the Judges aforeſaid, to be return'd accordingly.</p>
            <p>Let theſe Judges of the Poll be one or two of the moſt ſubſtantial Freeholders out of every Hundred, choſen for that purpoſe by the Freeholders of the Hundred, at the Summons of the High Conſtable, to ſome convenient Place in the Hundred, eight or ten days before the Election, and ſworn to be faithful to their Truſt.</p>
            <p>To avoid Charge or Trouble, the Court may be adjournd to ſo many Places in the County as may be moſt convenient, provided at the end of every Court the Box be ſeal'd by the Sheriff, and five or ſix of the Judges.</p>
            <p>Whereby the Sheriffs miſcarriages in Delays, falſe and double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, will be prevented.</p>
            <p>The vaſt profuſe and intollerable Expences of Competitors in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, avoided.</p>
            <p>The undue Impoſitions of Land-Lords and great Men, diſappointed.</p>
            <p>The ſhameful Drunkenneſs and unneighbourly Quarrels and Feuds, prevented.</p>
            <p>The chargeable and troubleſome Conteſts in Committees of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, removed.</p>
            <p>And an Obligation laid upon the Gentry to live vertuouſly, to gain the Affections of their Country.</p>
            <p>After this way may the Elections in Corporations be regulated, the Right of Election being ſettled by Act of Parliament in the Freemen, paying Scot and Lot.</p>
